Maintain existing code structure and organization.
Write unit tests for new functionality. Use table-driven unit tests when possible.
Document complex logic. Suggest changes to the `README.md` when appropriate.

Do not delete existing comments.
Prefer to use explicit type instead of var.
Prefer to assign new() or [] where possible.
Use tabs instead of spaces, even in XAML. A tab is equivalent to three spaces.
Use braces around single-line expressions.
Add a comma after the last item in an initializer list.
